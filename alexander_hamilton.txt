Lin Manuel Miranda (2015)

Hear ye! Hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury,
And I'd like to offer some free thoughts on the Continental Congress.

Heed not the rabble who scream "Revolution!"
They have not your interests at heart!
Chaos and bloodshed are not the solution,
Don't let them lead you astray!

This congress does not speak for me!
(Let him be)
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame.... for shame!
